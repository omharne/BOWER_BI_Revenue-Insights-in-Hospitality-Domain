Revenue Insights in Hospitality Domain
🔵 Problem Statement:

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.


📌 𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬:
After completing this task,I have gained a very good understanding of the #hospitalityindustry.
I learnt many new KPIs like major key measures that are important in the hotel business such as :
RevPar - Revenue per Room whether or not they are occupied. RevPAR helps hotels measure their revenue generating performance to accurately price rooms. RevPAR can help hotels measure themselves against other properties or brands
DSRN - Daily Sellable Room Night; This metrics tells on average how many rooms are ready to sell for a day considering a time period
ADR - Average Daily Rate;
DBRN - Daily Booked Room Nights; This metrics tells on average how many rooms are booked for a day considering a time period
DURN - Daily Utilized Room Nights. This metric tells on average how many rooms are succesfully utilized by customers for a day considering a time period
Occupancy % -means total successful bookings happened to the total rooms available(capacity)
Realisation %- means successful "checked out" percentage over all bookings happened.

🔍 Some of the important points from the above list of key learnings.

👉 𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐑𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬: Ratings and feedbacks play a very crucial role in determining business performance and future growth.
